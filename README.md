# Rationale, goals & manifesto
I want to use powerful, proven and stable environment for my daily work.
I prefer to use simple operations and compose them into bigger task over clicking cut icons.
I want to be as close to the wires as possible.

# Assumptions
* `bash` is almost every one server as well as `vim` and `python`
* you can express your self as `cli` pipline
* `python -c 'import this'`

# Inconvenience & naive solution
* how can I install & update my baby toolbox?
    - # TODO: one of thouse can be used: Makefile, setup.py, docker image?
    https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot  # looks promissing

* changing current directory to common one (i.e. git hub projects)
  - provide modified 'cd' command to move easy
  - use common prefix for each only command  to easy find it (i.e. '.cd')
