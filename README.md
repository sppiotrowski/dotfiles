# rationale & goals & manifesto
I want to use powerful, proven and stable environment for my daily work.
I prefer to use simple operations and compose them into bigger task over clicking cut icons.
I want to be as close to the wires as possible.

# assumptions
* `bash` is almost every one server as well as `vim` and `python`
* you can express your self as `cli` pipline
* python -c 'import this'

# naive solution
... TBD
